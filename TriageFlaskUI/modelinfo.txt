MODEL1.pkl is the file with the saved model, I've used the joblib library to save it and it can be loaded with:
# import joblib
# model = joblib.load('MODEL_1.pkl')
MODEL1 uses xgboost with a multiclass classifier to output either CAT1, CAT5 or OTHER
The notebook containing the code used to train the model is also in the folder.  It uses the INITIAL_TEXT dataset as its training data and expects two input variables:
TEXT (character) - the training data for this came from a concatenation of the PRESENTING_INFO plus PATIENT_PROBLEM_HISTORY, the user data can be free text
CHRONIC_HISTORY (numeric) - current training data is derived from PATIENT_PROBLEM_HISTORY: 0 = NA's, 1 = Not NAs... we will update this with Tori's new feature



MODEL2 expects the following inputs:
AGE (numeric)
PREGNANCY_STATUS (0 or 1)
AVPU (numeric: Alert=1, Verbal=2, Pain=3, Unresponsive=4)
SMOKING_STATUS (0 or 1)
Cardiovascular (0 or 1)
Mental_Health (0 or 1)
Toxicology (0 or 1)
Endocrine (0 or 1)
Neurology (0 or 1)
HR_critical (0 or 1:  definition of 1, data$HR_critical <- as.numeric(data$HEART_RATE_1 < 50 | data$HEART_RATE_1 > 150)
RR_LOW (0 or 1: definition of 1, data$RR_LOW <- as.numeric(data$RR_1 < 10)
BP_critical (0 or 1: definition of 1, data$BP_critical <- as.numeric(data$SBP_1 < 80)
TEXT (character) which is the same variable as in the previous model... and we reuse the same user input text in MODEL2
