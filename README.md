Masters of Data Science at James Cook University.
Group Project in R and Python to use hospital data to build using supervised machine learning to predict new patients' triage category from levels 1-5.

Initial exploration, data cleaning and analysis was done using R language and Tableau visualisation.
Numeric and categorical data was processed in different models. Principle Component Analysis was done to determine the most significant dependant variables.
Text columns in the data were processed using Natural Language Processing with Python NLTK.

The models were created in Python and run on AWS SageMaker using Keras and Tensorflow.
A Python Flask application was created to load the models, apply to new data and get predictions on the triage category based on principal variables.
